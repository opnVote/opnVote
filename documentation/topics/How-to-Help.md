# How to Help

If you are interested in helping `opnVote`, first of all huge thanks to you!

Currently, we are mostly focused on getting to the MVP-Stage, so our top-most priority are developers. If you know Rust, 
and want to help make democracy just a little bit easier for all, come and contribute to [the Repository](https://github.com/opnVote/opnVote)!


However, if you're not a developer and still want to help, don't hesitate to contact us! Shoot us an email at [contact@opn-vote.org](mailto:contact@opn-vote.org) or directly message us via [Mastodon](https://cyberplace.social/@opnvote) and we'll figure something out!
